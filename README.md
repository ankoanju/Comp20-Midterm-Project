# COMP20 - Midterm Project

## Hole Foods - Business and Site Information
Hole Foods is a fictional donut shop based in Medford MA. Currently located in areas: Medford, Tufts, and Boston/Chinatown, Hole Foods creates unique, hand-crafted doughnuts, made daily in small batches. We have over 20 different flavors, and more as seasonal offers. We've got dedicated doughnut designers who work around the clock to ensure we deliver the dreamiest, freshest doughnuts to our stores, seven days a week.

The website is useful for providing potential customers with basic information such as the type of donuts we sell, hours of operation, locations, and more. Without being present in the shop, customers can order delicious donuts as well as browse our creative related products online. The website also provides an easy layout that customers can easily navigate in order to obtain the information they need about the shop. Our website also reflects the unique atmosphere and pastel vibe that customers will experience when they go to the shop.

## Project requirement and how/where it was met
The list below explains where all the project requirement was met in our website:

    - Form included in ‘Catering’, ‘Contact Us’, and ‘Index’ page
- at least one page must have multiple columns
